Code written by Ryan Sanford under direction of Bart Massey
# Program Description
This program parses a TVG file and prints the parsed output to the console
# Program Usage
The C++ code was compiled using the standard g++ compiler, but any C++ compiler should suffice.
The program expects one argument on the command line, which is the path from the working directory to the .TVG file.
# Bugs and defects
This program is not compatible with .TVG files which use integers larger than 9. The program makes no promise of runtime
safety if this constraint is violated.
